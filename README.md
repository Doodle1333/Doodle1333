# Doodle

## About me
Hi, you can call me "doodle". This is because
I do not like putting my name on the internet, however,
I may change this in the future if required for some reason. 
So far I only have front-end knowledge, but I would like to be fullstack.

## What I know
I like to think I know a lot about programming. I could be wrong, I probably am since there is A LOT to learn (obviously). The programming languages I know ,at least enough to actually make something functional, is javascript. So far, i've just been creating projects for myself and messing around with js. Said projects are mostly just html files with external css and javscript files run in my browser via localhost, so I am very unfimiliar with things related to servers such as nodejs, php, SQL, things like that. However, I do have a very basic understanding of fetch and import/export. But that is as far as my knowledge goes when it comes to things related to servers.

In total, everything I know is
 
### server-side related (very basic understandings)
  - basic json
  - import/export
  - fetch

### client-side related
  - javascript
  - typescript (I barely know anything about this)
  - css
  - html

### recently (5/18/2022)
 - some python
 - using json/text files with python
